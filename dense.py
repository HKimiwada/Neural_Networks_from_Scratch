# Problem statement: the dataset is dots in spiral form. There are several spirals. Each dot in the spiral is one of three colors.
# Create NN to classify each dot. Eseentially, the input will be two dimensional (X,Y) and output is three dimensional.

# Dense Layer Class:
# Class that, when given number of neurons and number inputs, generates output
# Class randomly assigns, weights, and biases to each neuron.
# np.dot(input, Weight) + bias -> Weight (1st column: Weight of neuron 1, 2nd column: Weight of neuron 2 etc...)
# Weights matrix: inputs x neurons, Bias: neuron number
